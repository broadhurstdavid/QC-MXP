QC-MXP was developed using OSX Matlab running on either a 2021 Apple Macbook Pro with M1 Silicon processor & a 2019 Apple Macbook Pro with Intel i9 processor. 
The final OSX versions were compiled using Matlab 2024a(Silicon) & Matab 2024a(Intel).
The application was then recomplied on on Windows 10 & Windows 11 using Parallels Desktop for Mac virutal machines.
99% on the testing was perfromed on the OSX version. There are a few querky differences between the Windows and OSX versions of Matlab.
As such I expect some superficial unusual behavoiur on the Windows versions. Please, let me know if there is anything major and I will create parallel Windows source code directory and make changes as required.
