Version 2 was developed using Matlab running on a 2021 Apple Macbook Pro with M1 Silicon processor. The final OSX versions were compiled using Matlab 2025a(Silicon) & Matab 2025a(Intel). The application was then recompiled on on Windows 10 & Windows 11 using Parallels Desktop for Mac virtual machines. 99% on the testing was performed on the OSX version. There are a few quirky differences between the Windows and OSX versions of Matlab. As such I expect some superficial unusual behavior on the Windows versions. Please, let me know if there is anything major and I will create parallel Windows source code directory and make changes as required.
